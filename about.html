        <h3>Hello, I am Yash. I am extremely happy and grateful that among 8 billion people on this planet, you are the special one who visited my page. Be proud of yourself!</h3>

        <h2>My Information:</h2>
        <h3>
            My name is Yash, and I am currently studying in class 8 at Holy Cross School. I have a passion for coding and building beautiful websites through programming. I began my coding journey in 2024, and although I am still learning, I am excited about the progress I’ve made.
            <br><br>
            At this point, I have learned over three programming languages. I understand that this may be a small number, but please don't judge me. I believe that learning is a continuous journey, and I’m excited to keep growing in this field.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I am focusing on mastering React.js. My main goal in coding is to become an expert in frontend development. I have decided to deepen my expertise in frontend technologies first, before diving into backend languages. I believe in building a strong foundation before expanding to other areas of development.
            <br><br>
            That’s a little about me. I hope we can connect more in the future. Have a wonderful day ahead!
